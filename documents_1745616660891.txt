        "title": "Effective Prompting",
        "text": "Effective Prompting The way you ask changes everything. Microsoft Copilot is only as powerful as the prompt you give it. The difference between an “okay” result and a “wow” answer? It’s how you ask. Structure Matters Use this 4-part formula to craft effective prompts: [Goal] + [Context] + [Style] + [Constraints] Example: \"Summarize the last quarterly report in 150 words, highlight 3 action points, and format for a LinkedIn post.\" Get Specific Bad Prompt: \"Write about productivity\" Better Prompt: \"Create a 200-word article on 3 evidence-based productivity habits for remote teams. Use a conversational tone.\" Refine on the Fly Copilot not quite there? Ask follow-ups like: \"Make it more formal\" \"Add a quote from Satya Nadella\" \"Shorten it by 50 words\" Tip:  Think of Copilot like a junior analyst or assistant — the clearer your instructions, the more value it delivers. Copilot Power Prompts Copy. Paste. Impress. Try these ready-to-go prompts for your daily grind — tweak as needed. In Outlook \"Draft a follow-up email summarizing our call with Acme Inc. Include next steps and a polite closing.\" In Excel \"Analyze this spreadsheet for unusual trends. Highlight cells where monthly revenue dropped more than 20%.\" In Word \"Rewrite this paragraph in formal tone for a client presentation. Keep it under 100 words.\" In Edge or Bing \"Summarize this article in bullet points for someone who has 2 minutes to spare.\" For Managers \"Create a performance review summary for a direct report who has exceeded expectations in project delivery, but needs to improve communication clarity.\" Would you like me to also prepare a second batch (\"Advanced Prompt Engineering\" or \"Building Your First Copilot Agent\") next, to keep the momentum going? 🚀"

        "text": "Building Agents Learn how to turn Copilot into a reusable, context-aware assistant that follows structured workflows and delivers consistent results — just like a real team member. Microsoft Copilot  is great for answering questions, but when you want  repeatable results  with minimal prompting, you need to build a simple  agent  — a prompt that defines a persona, a task, and a consistent output style. What Is a Copilot Agent? Agents are structured prompts that simulate roles like: A content editor who always writes in a friendly tone A project manager who summarizes status reports A data analyst who highlights risks in spreadsheets They’re not official Copilot features (yet), but you can build them using prompt design alone. Why Use Agents? Agents help you: Standardize  tone, format, and task execution Reduce re-prompting  for similar tasks Scale your style  across different tools (Word, Outlook, Excel) How to Build a Copilot Agent Start with this structure: Role:  Define the voice or persona Example:  “You are a senior content editor for a SaaS company.” Goal:  Define the task clearly Example:  “Edit long-form blog posts to improve clarity and reduce wordiness.” Tone and Format:  Set constraints Example:  “Use a confident tone, limit to 600 words, and end with a call to action.” Workflow:  Optionally add steps Example:  “Step 1: Highlight jargon. Step 2: Simplify. Step 3: Suggest alternatives.” Agent Template Use this structure to create your own: Role:  [Who is the assistant?] Goal:  [What should it accomplish?] Tone/Style:  [What should it sound like?] Workflow:  [Optional: Steps or tasks to follow] Constraints:  [Length, tone, formatting] Example: Agent Prompt You are a senior financial analyst. Your job is to summarize quarterly reports for executive stakeholders. Use a professional tone, limit to 250 words, and include 3 bullet points for key risks. Always end with a recommendation for next steps."
