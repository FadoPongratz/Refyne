This site is a personal project ‚Äî a growing collection of ideas, templates, and smart shortcuts to help people  get more out of AI , even if they‚Äôre not developers, data scientists, or ‚Äúpower users.‚Äù Whether you're just curious about tools like ChatGPT and Copilot, or you want to use AI to streamline real work ‚Äî you're in the right place. üéØ Why I built this I've spent the last year using AI every day ‚Äî at work, at home, for research, for writing, for solving real problems. Along the way, I‚Äôve learned what works, what doesn't, and what makes AI actually useful (instead of just impressive). So I started writing things down. And one thing became another... and here we are. üí° What you‚Äôll find here Simple guides  to set up and tune tools like ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot Real-world workflows  and project ideas anyone can reuse Prompt libraries  that make you sound smart without sounding robotic A growing  toolkit for thinking with AI  ‚Äì clearly, calmly, and effectively üöÄ Who this is for Curious minds who want to do more with less effort Busy professionals who don‚Äôt have time to read the manual AI skeptics who just want it to  work already You, if you've ever thought:  ‚ÄúI know it can do more‚Ä¶ but how?‚Äù This isn‚Äôt a product. It‚Äôs a  refyne-ment  ‚Äî of how we ask, how we think, and how we work with AI. Let‚Äôs get started."

        "text": "Effective Prompting In recent feedback discussions, it became clear that AI responses are often perceived as unfit or unsatisfactory. It is important to recognize that the quality of AI output is directly dependent on the quality of the prompt provided. The key insight:  The better the input, the better the output. Different formulations will yield different results. If you have the opportunity, experiment with alternative phrasings and observe how slight changes in wording impact the output. To improve the precision and usefulness of AI responses, a few basic principles can be incorporated: Basic Rules for Effective Prompting 1. Be Clear and Specific Principle:  AI models perform best with unambiguous instructions. Application:  Define content type, style, structure, audience, and level of detail. Example: OK:  \"Summarize this text.\" Better:  \"Summarize the following text in five bullet points, focusing on key financial drivers, using a professional and neutral tone.\" 2. Define Role and Context Principle:  Assigning a role shapes the tone and behavior of the AI. Application:  Specify a persona or clear task boundaries. Example: \"Act as a senior consultant preparing a client-facing executive summary for a private equity investor.\" 3. Structure the Output Principle:  Structured prompts lead to structured responses. Application:  Request bullet points, numbered lists, tables, or section headers where appropriate. Example: \"Prepare a two-part analysis: 1) Key Risks, 2) Mitigating Factors, each in bullet points.\" 4. Set Style and Tone Expectations Principle:  Output style (e.g., professional, casual, persuasive) strongly influences reception. Application:  Clearly state tone requirements and any specific conventions. Example: \"Use a formal, analytical tone, avoid marketing language, and prefer neutral, fact-based wording.\" 5. Break Complex Requests into Steps Principle:  Stepwise instructions reduce misunderstandings and fragmentation. Application:  Divide complex tasks into sequential steps. Example: \"First, summarize the text in one paragraph. Then, list three critical assumptions. Finally, suggest one potential improvement.\" 6. Use Examples Where Helpful Principle:  Examples help illustrate expectations more clearly than abstract instructions. Application:  Provide templates, samples, or illustrative examples. Example: \"Please use the following format: [Deal Overview: ..., Financial Highlights: ..., Risks: ...]\" 7. State Constraints Explicitly Principle:  Clear boundaries prevent unwanted deviations. Application:  Define length limits, excluded phrases, or specific content requirements. Example: \"Limit the response to 200 words. Avoid using phrases like 'in the course of this due diligence'.\" 8. Flag Open Issues Clearly Principle:  Marking incomplete or unclear areas maintains transparency. Application:  Instruct the AI to identify open points explicitly. Example: \"Mark missing data points with \"Outstanding!\" and suggest clarifying questions where appropriate.\""

        "text": "Using AI for AI Here‚Äôs a little golden rule most people forget: If your AI output isn‚Äôt great, don‚Äôt just blame the model ‚Äî ask the model how to fix it. Seriously. You can use ChatGPT (or Copilot, or your favorite AI) to: Improve your own prompts Audit and debug weak responses Generate better formatting, tone, or structure Even write the instructions for a  Custom GPT  that helps you prompt better! üß† Think Like This: ‚ÄúHow can I get AI to help me  get better at using AI ?‚Äù Try These Meta-Prompts Here are a few examples to get you going: ‚ÄúHow could I improve this prompt to get clearer, more concise output?‚Äù ‚ÄúRewrite this to focus on executive-level insights.‚Äù ‚ÄúTurn this one-off question into a reusable prompt template.‚Äù ‚ÄúAct as a prompt engineer and review this for weaknesses.‚Äù Make It Recursive üîÅ Want to take it further? Build a  Custom GPT  that  specializes  in prompt design. Give it instructions like: You are a prompt engineer who helps users improve their AI prompts. You give suggestions for structure, clarity, tone, and task separation. Then... use that GPT to help you build your  next  GPT. (Yes.

        "title": "Getting Started",
        "text": "Getting Started ChatGPT is already a powerful tool out of the box. But with just a few small adjustments, you can dramatically improve how it responds ‚Äî making it more accurate, more helpful, and better suited to your workflow. This guide shows you how to  customize ChatGPT settings  to match your communication style and use  Customs GPTs  /  Projects  to organize your work. Customize ChatGPT Start by telling ChatGPT how you want it to behave. This takes just a minute and changes everything. 1. Open Customization In the ChatGPT web app: Click your name or profile icon (top right corner) Select  ‚ÄúCustomize ChatGPT‚Äù This feature is available to all users, even on the free plan. 2. Set Behavior Preferences You'll see multiple customization fields: \" What should ChatGPT call you?\"   What to write:  Your preferred name or nickname ‚Äî this helps ChatGPT address you more naturally. However, you can also tell ChatGPT to call you Honey or Baby in case its been a while since you had a signifcant other.  What do you do? Now here things are starting to get interessting. Within this field, you can give ChatGPT context. This field should be used to tell ChatGPT who you are and what you do to give it the heavily needed context ond what you expect out of it.  Goal:  Describe your current profession or main role. Include side jobs or aspirations if relevant. Tips: Be concise but specific (include your field, level, and type of work). Include side businesses or relevant context for personalized help. What traits should ChatGPT have? Goal:  Define how ChatGPT should behave ‚Äî tone, interaction style, and depth. Tips: Be explicit: formal/informal, brief/elaborate, critical/supportive. Combine tone and role: e.g., ‚Äúneutral and precise assistant for legal research‚Äù. In my personal experience, I had the issue that ChatGPT responded extremly postively, often reinforcing something that I said in my prompt. So in my prompt, I am asking ChatGPT to specifically not do that.   Example   You are an experienced AI assistant and professional consultant. Your role is to support a professional user named [NAME] in performing various analytical, editorial, and structural tasks. **General Style and Interaction Rules:** ‚Äì Always address the user as ‚Äú[NAME]‚Äù. ‚Äì Remain strictly neutral and refrain from automatically affirming inputs. ‚Äì Use clear, structured, and logically ordered language. ‚Äì Offer well-reasoned alternatives when something seems unbalanced or unclear. Please note that you can also use trait tags to insert the wanted functionality here.  Anything else ChatGPT should know about you?   Goal:  Define detailed style, rules, or priorities that should apply across all conversations. Tips: Write as a list of instructions. Include formatting preferences, communication style, and your goals. Example Ton:  Professionell, sachlich und strukturiert ‚Äì gern freundlich und zug√§nglich, aber ohne √ºberm√§√üige Zustimmung. Bitte vermeide es, Aussagen reflexartig zu best√§tigen. Stil:  Klare Sprache, kurze Abs√§tze, gerne Bullet Points. Komplexe Themen logisch gliedern. Wenn Aussagen unvollst√§ndig sind, bitte gezielt hinterfragen. Ziel:  Effizienz, fachliche Tiefe und Struktur. Fokus auf Due Diligence, Finanzanalyse und Beratung. 3. Advanced Capabilities  Web Browsing (Internetsuche) This allows ChatGPT to search the internet in real time. Use it when you need up-to-date information ‚Äî such as current prices, regulations, or recent events. DALL¬∑E This enables image generation from text prompts. It's useful for visual content like mockups, diagrams, thumbnails, or creative concepts. Code Interpreter (Code) This activates programming tools, including Python code execution and file analysis. Ideal for data analysis, automation tasks, or working with CSV/Excel files. Canvas This opens a side-by-side editing interface for documents and code. Great for working on longer texts, reports, or structured outputs ‚Äî especially if you want to edit only parts of a document without rewriting the whole thing. Advanced Voice Mode (Fortgeschrittener Audiomodus) Enables voice input and output. Optional ‚Äî good for users who prefer speaking to typing, but not essential for professional use. Cusomize ChatGPT Start by telling ChatGPT how you want it to behave. This takes just a minute and changes everything. 1 Customize ChatGPT In your CHat GPT App, on the upper right corner click on your profile button and select \"customize ChatGPT\" 2 Step Title Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
